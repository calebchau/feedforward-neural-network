# Feedforward Neural Network

Practiced implementing a fully-connected feedforward neural network using numpy
and tested performance by classifying handwritten digits provided by the MNIST
dataset.

## Usage
```
python3 test.py
```
You can mess with the network's structure and hyperparameters by changing the
values used in test.py when initializing and training the network.
